//navigate to pi directoy

//create a script we want to run
sudo nano /etc/init.d/NameOfYourScript

//make script runnable 
sudo chmod 755 /etc/init.d/NameOfYourScript

// run this in terminal
sudo update-rc.d NameOfYourScript defaults

//NameOfYourScript is where ever the get function is stored just changed the names and try running in init
//run this and then restart the pi, it should start getting the data live

//after that works:
//do the same thing with the file we wrote to decode the messages
or put the get function inside the decode file
